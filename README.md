# Compiler_Course_Project

This was the course project for my Compiler course. It is an implementation of a financial DSL, and takes as input a code in that language, 
which is a definition of some contracts, and returns a C++ code which outputs the maximum profit attainable from those contracts. It 
uses Scala's parser combinators to parse the code, also the interpreter is done in Scala.

TODO : add in the specification of the language here, and clean-up the code.
